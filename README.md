  ## ðŸ’¬ Manual User Creation and Database Setup

  - Open MongoDB shell or your MongoDB management tool.
  - Create a new database called todo-app.
  - Create a new collection called users.
  - Insert a new user document with the following structure:
    
```
{
  "password": "$2b$10$hashedPasswordHere", // Hash the password before saving
  "name": "User Name"
}
```

- Your MongoDB setup should look like this:
    
```
- todo-app
  - users
    - { "password": "$2b$10$hashedPasswordHere", "name": "User Name" }
```

- You can now log in with the user credentials you created.
